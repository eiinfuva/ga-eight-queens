Calculus of the N-Queens problem with Genetic Algorithms in Python.
====

You only need to execute main.py, it will create a .log file in the same 
directory for debug, the genetic algorithm doesn't seem to converge to a 
real solution to the problem right now, maybe changing some values it
would work correctly.
